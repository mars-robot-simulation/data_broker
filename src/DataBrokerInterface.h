/*
 * 
 * 
 * HOW TO:
 *  1) producer:
 *     - push an initial data set and get an ID back
 *     - then call pushData(ID, ...)
 *  2) receiver:
 *     a) Asynchronous (this should be the default):
 *        - call registerAsyncReceiver() with (sensor group and name)
 *        - updates the receiver from another thread than the pushing thread.
 *        NOTE: If the producer pushes fast you only receive the last datum.
 *     b) Synchronous
 *        - call registerSyncReceiver() with (sensor group and name)
 *        - updates the receiver from within the pushData-call.
 *        NOTE: only use this if it is important that you don't miss a datum.
 *     c) Timed:
 *        - call createTimer() with a suitable name
 *        - call registerTimedReceiver() with a desired update period
 *        - call stepTimer() to step the timer and get the updates
 *        NOTE: you will get the latest datum. regardless whether it's been 
 *              updated or not since the last update.
 *     d) Triggered:
 *        - call createTrigger() with a suitable triggerName
 *        - call registerTriggered() to register to a certain trigger
 *        - call trigger() to manually trigger a certain trigger and update 
 *          all receivers registered to it.
 *        NOTE: you will get the latest datum. regardless whether it's been 
 *              updated or not since the last update.
 *
 * TYPICAL USECASES:
 *  1) Plotter:
 *     should run in Asynchronous or Timed mode
 *  2) File Logger:
 *     should run in Asynchronous or Timed mode
 *  3) Controller:
 *     should probably run in Asynchronous mode.
 *  4) Command:
 *     When listening for commands you should run in Synchronous mode.
